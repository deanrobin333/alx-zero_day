**3. Collaboration is the base of a company**
- For this project, create a branch `update_script` and in this branch:
- Create an empty file named `bash/98`
- Update `bash/alx` by replacing `echo "ALX"` with `echo "ALX School"`
- Update `bash/school` by replacing `echo "School"` with `echo "The school is open!"`
- Add and commit these changes (message: “My personal work”)
- Push this new branch
<br></br>
- Perfect! You did an amazing update in your project and it’s isolated correctly from the **main** branch.
- Ho wait, your manager needs a quick fix in your project and it needs to be deployed now:
<br></br>
- Change branch to `main`
- Update the file `bash/alx` by replacing `echo "ALX"` with `echo "ALX School is so cool!"`
- Delete the directory `js`
- Commit your changes (message: “Hot fix”) and push to the origin

**4. Collaboration: be up to date**
- For this task – **and only for this task** – please update your file `README.md` in the main branch from GitHub.com. It’s the **only time** you are allowed to update and commit from GitHub interface.
- After you have done that, in your terminal:
	- Get all changes of the main branch locally (i.e. your `README.md` file will be updated)
	- Create a new file `up_to_date` at the root of your directory and in it, write the git command line used
	- Add `up_to_date` to git, commit (message: “How to be up to date in git”), and push to the origin
<br></br>
- Repo
    - GitHub repository: `alx-zero_day`
    - Directory: `0x03-git`
    - File: `README.md, up_to_date`
